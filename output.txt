Dear  JPMorgan Chase & Co , 
 
With the utmost eagerness, I want to express my interest and passion for the Software 
Engineer Intern position. As a tenacious and logical -thinking driven employee, I know my 
versatile skills and qualifications will make me an asset to the team.  
 
As you will find on my CV, I have had a variety of experiences in software development and 
machine learning, from my time at Nutritoken to my time at  Market’s Mojo . I am looking to 
make the next step in my career by leveraging my technical and programming skills to 
contribute to JPMorgan Chase & Co  ‘s cutting -edge trading applications.  
 
As a prospective employee, I immediately can bring the following qualities to the team:  
Proficiency in Programming Languages : My career has provided me with strong 
programming foundations. At Nutritoken, I collaborated closely with a talented team to 
design and build the platform from the ground up. Together, we developed the architecture 
and created the Alpha version, which integrated multiple features such as user 
management, token tracking, and API interactions with third -party services. My 
contributions, alongside the team's efforts, ensured the platform's scalability and ease of 
use, helping to realise the startup's mission of promoting healthy dietary habits among 
students.  
 
Machine Learning Expertise: My time at Markets Mojo allowed me to delve deep into 
machine learning. I developed an NER model aimed at reducing the operational costs of 
running a chatbot. This project involved extensive research on ML architectures, data 
cleaning, and dataset creation. The outcome was a more efficient chatbot, leading to 
reduced costs and improved user interaction.  
 
While my CV provides a quick summary of my experiences, I hope to have the opportunity 
to share how I can bring value to your company’s needs.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Kanishk Dutta
